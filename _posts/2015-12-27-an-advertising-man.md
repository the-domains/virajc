I am an Advertising Man. I write long copy on short deadlines and pick smart words for small headlines. Doing proactive, hyperactive and sometimes inactive work, I'm just a simple guy who writes complex sentences while giving big ideas to small brands. A quick-thinking slowpoke with a sharp wit and a soft heart, easily selling everything from lotions to potions. A tea-drinking, cigarette-smoking and occasionally party-loving wallflower who's left handed but right up front. A tall guy with big dreams and small needs, a geek who's hi-tech but low maintenance with a musical soul and a writer's heart. Born in the body of a peace loving urban hippie with a penchant for obscure bands and popular art. Just a writer by day and a gamer by night, rhyming all the time and being accidentally creative surprisingly often.

I'm out of the box and in the loop. Living in the moment, online, on time and off the charts. Off centre from the get go, below the belt but I'll let you know. The right man with a wrong view and a positive man who likes negative space. I live easy and love strong, going out on a limb to find my feet, seeing my remarks are often recycled. Constantly being recreated, reproduced, reinvented and well received as a thin man with thick hair betting on slim chances with fat returns.

I'm a professional copywriter, a nocturnal songwriter and a hopeful screenwriter. 

So I pray this little autobiography opens your mind and my portfolio, on the chance that you might find room for me at your agency.

Hopefully yours,

Viraj Chouhan
